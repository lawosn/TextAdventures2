# Haunted School Story:
# You wake up to the sound of your wonderful iPhone alarm.
# You look around, and notice you never went home after school.
# "Huh, weird" you say to yourself as you walk to the bathroom to get ready.
# While in the bathroom, you see blood flowing out from under a stall.
# What do you do?
# 1. Investigate
# 2. Act like nothing happened

# If you choose to investigate:
# You break down the stall door, and there a creature awaits you.
# Without much delay or talk, the creature jumps at you and kills you.

# If you choose to act like nothing happened:
# You go about your routine as usual, albeit in an unsual location.
# When you walk out of the bathroom, you notice the rest of your stuff is gone.
# You assume it was just one of your friends that arrived super early
# and brought your stuff to class for you.
# You start heading to your first class.
# There is a creepy sound following you as you go through the hallway.
# What do you do?
# 1. Keep going
# 2. Run home
