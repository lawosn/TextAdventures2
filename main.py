# Haunted School Story:
# You wake up to the sound of your wonderful iPhone alarm.
# You look around, and notice you never went home after school.
# "Huh, weird" you say to yourself as you walk to the bathroom to get ready.
# While in the bathroom, you see blood flowing out from under a stall.
# What do you do?
# 1. Investigate
# 2. Act like nothing happened
